# The mega course recommender
This has been an idea (since a long time) to create a curated list of courses (for various topics) so that beginners can get benefitted from that list! And I feel this is a very great time to start the project as there are many students looking for a project to contribute to in this **Hacktoberfest**

## How can you contribute?
1. Fork this repo
2. clone your version of the repo
3. create a new-branch and switch to it.
4. Well, you just have to create a <your_username>.md file and add at least 4 courses (paid/free) to it. Your file should be in the following format:

```
topic_one : course_title : course_link
topic_two : course_title : course_link
topic_three : course_title : course_link
topic_four : course_title : course_link
```

actual example
```
python : the complete python course : https://udemy.com/complete-python
```

Please follow the same format else I would have to mark your pull request as invalid (I don't want to)!

6. add, commit and push the change
7. create a pull request!
8. Follow me on instagram 😋 <a href="https://instagram.com/arpancodes">@arpancodes</a>(obviously an optional step, but it will benefit you TRUST ME 😉).

If we get enough data this by mid of hacktober we might start the actual project this hacktober only!
All the best!
